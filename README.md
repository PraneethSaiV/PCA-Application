#<h1> PCA-Application </h1>

Contains an R - shiny application that currently runs on the local host (webrgl package is now not supported on shiny servers, hence
does not output the 3D PCA plot). 

Application features:
1. Interactive 3D PCA plot
2. Interactive Heat map
3. Clustering on Heat map (added as a feature)
